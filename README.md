This is a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learning-equality-curriculum-recommendations/overview) hosted by The Learning Agency Lab. <br/>

## Goal of the Competition
The goal of this competition is to streamline the process of matching educational content to specific topics in a curriculum. You will develop an accurate and efficient model trained on a library of K-12 educational materials that have been organized into a variety of topic taxonomies. These materials are in diverse languages, and cover a wide range of topics, particularly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).
